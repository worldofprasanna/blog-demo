Recently I was worrying a bit about not having time for anything and I could
see that I miss most of my regular activities as well. Thought could note
down the reason for those, so that I can step back and see it from a
different perspective,

1. Not knowing what to do with the time. I feel most of my time was spent in
youtube videos, songs which is not bad. But I don t know what to do with the
time and hence seeing all the recommended videos given by google.

2. Not having a learning path. I think this is much needed, having sometime
to improve on the things which I already know. I miss that part of building
to something which am good at.

3. Thinking about it too much rather than doing it. Even though I experienced
it a lot, couldn t come out of it. Doing a task is much more simpler than
worrying about how to do it.

4. Having a feeling that I was over burnt. This is a killer. I was always
having a feeling that I over worked and its time to take rest. But actually
its not the case ;-)

To do,

1. Do things & improve on things which am already good at
2. Drive by passion. There are lot of things which I want to do and always
focus on it rather than focussing on nothing.
3. Find time. Concrete time. Per schedule have min of 1 hour and have 2 slots
like that.
4. Talk to lot of people. Find common passion & Get their opion of how they are doing things.
5. Think from the future. From 5 years now, what I would want this time to be
spent.
6. Stop doing things which are not planned. Always have a plan and prepare
for that and do it. It gives lot more satisfaction than just doing things
which comes to me.

What are the things I want to do:

Already started, and came out of beginner level:
1. Learn more about vim
2. Write tamil kavithai, blog
3. create beautiful sites. master css & styling.
4. organise things in a perfect way.
5. terraform, docker, aws course
6. Read fav author s book and biography
7. Gym. Shuttle. Jogging.

Passionate about:
1. UX. Adobe photoshop or simpler tools
2. Bike internals. Dismantle and build it again.
3. Communicate clearly and effectively. Always think from the perspective of
listener.
4. English. Its a beautiful lang too. Master at it.
5. Telugu. Try to converse fluently in that.
